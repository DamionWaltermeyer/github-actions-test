Filter pattern cheat sheet
You can use special characters in path, branch, and tag filters.

*: Matches zero or more characters, but does not match the / character. For example, Octo* matches Octocat.
**: Matches zero or more of any character.
?: Matches zero or one single character. For example, Octoc?t matches Octocat.
+: Matches one or more of the preceding character.
[] Matches one character listed in the brackets or included in ranges. Ranges can only include a-z, A-Z, and 0-9. For example, the range[0-9a-f] matches any digits or lowercase letter. For example, [CB]at matches Cat or Bat and [1-2]00 matches 100 and 200.
!: At the start of a pattern makes it negate previous positive patterns. It has no special meaning if not the first character.
The characters *, [, and ! are special characters in YAML. If you start a pattern with *, [, or !, you must enclose the pattern in quotes.

Patterns to match branches and tags
Pattern	Description	Example matches
feature/*	The * wildcard matches any character, but does not match slash (/).	-feature/my-branch
-feature/your-branch
feature/**	The ** wildcard matches any character including slash (/) in branch and tag names.	-feature/beta-a/my-branch
-feature/your-branch
-feature/mona/the/octocat
-main
-releases/mona-the-octcat	Matches the exact name of a branch or tag name.	-main
-releases/mona-the-octocat
'*'	Matches all branch and tag names that don't contain a slash (/). The * character is a special character in YAML. When you start a pattern with *, you must use quotes.	-main
-releases
'**'	Matches all branch and tag names. This is the default behavior when you don't use a branches or tags filter.	-all/the/branches
-every/tag
'*feature'	The * character is a special character in YAML. When you start a pattern with *, you must use quotes.	-mona-feature
-feature
-ver-10-feature
v2*	Matches branch and tag names that start with v2.	-v2
-v2.0
-v2.9
v[12].[0-9]+.[0-9]+	Matches all semantic versioning tags with major version 1 or 2	-v1.10.1
-v2.0.0
Patterns to match file paths
Path patterns must match the whole path, and start from the repository's root.

Pattern	Description of matches	Example matches
'*'	The * wildcard matches any character, but does not match slash (/). The * character is a special character in YAML. When you start a pattern with *, you must use quotes.	-README.md
-server.rb
'*.jsx?'	The ? character matches zero or one of the preceding character.	-page.js
-page.jsx
'**'	The ** wildcard matches any character including slash (/). This is the default behavior when you don't use a path filter.	-all/the/files.md
'*.js'	The * wildcard matches any character, but does not match slash (/). Matches all .js files at the root of the repository.	-app.js
-index.js
'**.js'	Matches all .js files in the repository.	-index.js
-js/index.js
-src/js/app.js
docs/*	All files within the root of the docs directory, at the root of the repository.	-docs/README.md
-docs/file.txt
docs/**	Any files in the /docs directory at the root of the repository.	-docs/README.md
-docs/mona/octocat.txt
docs/**/*.md	A file with a .md suffix anywhere in the docs directory.	-docs/README.md
-docs/mona/hello-world.md
-docs/a/markdown/file.md
'**/docs/**'	Any files in a docs directory anywhere in the repository.	-/docs/hello.md
-dir/docs/my-file.txt
-space/docs/plan/space.doc
'**/README.md'	A README.md file anywhere in the repository.	-README.md
-js/README.md
'**/*src/**'	Any file in a folder with a src suffix anywhere in the repository.	-a/src/app.js
-my-src/code/js/app.js
'**/*-post.md'	A file with the suffix -post.md anywhere in the repository.	-my-post.md
-path/their-post.md
'**/migrate-*.sql'	A file with the prefix migrate- and suffix .sql anywhere in the repository.	-migrate-10909.sql
-db/migrate-v1.0.sql
-db/sept/migrate-v1.sql
-*.md
-!README.md	Using an exclamation mark (!) in front of a pattern negates it. When a file matches a pattern and also matches a negative pattern defined later in the file, the file will not be included.	-hello.md
Does not match
-README.md
-docs/hello.md
-*.md
-!README.md
-README*	Patterns are checked sequentially. A pattern that negates a previous pattern will re-include file paths.	-hello.md
-README.md
-README.doc
